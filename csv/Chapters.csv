<p>Starting in the 1800s, the Patwin were forcibly removed from their villages and hunting lands through successive waves of colonization: from the Spanish mission project, in which Patwin villages were raided for laborers, slaves, and converts; to an epidemic of malaria introduced by European trappers in the river valley; to the claims and appropriation of indigenous land for the Spanish land grants followed by the Gold Rush; to the ultimate relocation of remaining Patwin to federally created rancherías or reservations. </p>
<p>Today’s surviving Patwin communities include the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, who are now based along Cache Creek in the Capay Valley of eastern Yolo County, having reclaimed the fertile lowland river corridor after being relocated to the dry upper reaches of the valley in Rumsey. The term Patwin, or Wintun Tʼewe, refers more precisely to the language traditionally spoken in this region.

,,,,"In 2014, birds and other wildlife of the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area inspired over 50 professional and amateur artists to create a beautiful  mural on the Education trailer at the Yolo Demonstration Wetlands. This community based volunteer labor of love expresses appreciation for the beauty of the creatures and plants that inhabit the Wildlife Area. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Conclusions: The Continuing Story,,,What makes the Vic Fazio Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area so special?,"<p>It is the location on the Pacific Flyway in view of the State Capitol, a wild place in an urban setting.</p>
<p>It is the wildlife: over 200 species of birds, the chance to see beavers, otters, mink, snakes, and butterflies.</p>
<p>It is the thousands of bats flying out from under the Yolo Causeway every summer evening.</p>
<p>It is the Fish and Wildlife staff who manage the area in the heat, the  cold and in the wind. It is the farmers and ranchers who are willing to try new approaches.</p>
<p>It is the Yolo Basin Foundation staff and the hundreds of dedicated volunteers who make school field trips possible. They spend their weekends working behind the scenes at California Ducks Days, sitting at an information table at Parking Lot A, or leading field trips so that new people can enjoy the wetlands. They serve food at Bucks for Ducks and stuff envelopes with invitations. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>It is the visitors that make this place special: the teachers, the parents, the thousands of students who visit every year, many of them experiencing nature for the first time.</p>
<p>It is the  birders and other wildlife viewers, the hikers, painters, photographers, anglers, hunters, people of all walks of life and all ages taking time out of their busy lives to spend time in a peaceful place.</p>
<p>It is a community story–</p>
<p>Over 30 years ago a small group of people came together with an idea: to recreate the wetlands of the Putah Creek Sinks.  They had their training as ecologists,  a map and the energy to act on a vision of a future landscape. What started as a local project has taken on national  or even international stature.</p>
<p>The effort to create the Wildlife Area is the story of a community working together. That community is an element of the partnerships that made this place possible.  It is  more than the logos on a big sign on I-80.  The community is  a continuously growing group of visitors, colleagues and friends who love this place.</p>
<p>The Wildlife Area is a wonderful place for birds and people.  It is also a vision for the future: the successful co-existence of agriculture, flood protection, wildlife habitat, recreation and education in a growing metropolis.</p>
