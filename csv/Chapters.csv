The Watershed and the Flyway,watershed,"The <strong>Central Valley</strong>, California's agricultural heartland, is an 18,000-square-mile sedimentary valley, fed by vast watershed of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. ","The valley's drainage area extends to the crests of the Sierra Nevada and the coast range, a catchment for rain and snowmelt that encompasses 60,000 square miles. Water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries converge at the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta--a highly modified landscape of tidal sloughs and canals surrounding levee-protected agricultural lowlands--before flowing out to sea via the San Francisco Bay.",,,,-121.63123,38.56149,7,Hidden,,,,media/legends/legend_watershed.png,tiles/watershed/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,,,,,,,,
